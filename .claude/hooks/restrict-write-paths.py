Title: restrict-write-paths
Usage: PreToolUse hook on Write|Edit|NotebookEdit (reads hook JSON on stdin)

Description:
Denies any file write whose target resolves outside the allowed roots. The
sandbox already confines Bash to these directories; this closes the same gap
for the file tools, which the sandbox does not cover.

Symlinks are resolved first, so ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md is allowed once stow has
linked it into ~/dotfiles, and a symlink pointing out of the repo is not.
