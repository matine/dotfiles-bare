Title: generate-cheatsheet
Usage: ./scripts/generate-cheatsheet.py [-o OUTPUT_DIR]

Description:
Parses every file in this repo that defines a keybinding or an alias and
writes one sheet per tool into cheatsheets/, plus an index.md.

Some tools have no config in this repo to parse -- Raycast keeps its hotkeys in
an app database, Lazygit ships its keys as built-in defaults -- so those
sections are hand-written. Anything between a pair of MANUAL markers is
preserved verbatim across runs -- edit it freely.

Stdlib only, no timestamp in the output, so re-running produces a clean diff.
